    Every day, tons of edible food go to waste while many people remain hungry.  
    The **Local Food Wastage Management System** aims to tackle this by connecting:
    - **Food Providers** (restaurants, NGOs, caterers, hotels) who have surplus food  
    - **Receivers** (shelters, food banks, orphanages) who are in need of food  

    Through this system, we can:
    - Streamline food donation and distribution  
    - Reduce wastage by optimizing logistics based on **location and demand**  
    - Gain data-driven insights to **improve efficiency and equity**
